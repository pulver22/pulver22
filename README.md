## 🌱 Research

I explore how aerial and ground robots collaborate to achieve long-term autonomy under uncertainty and seasonal change.
       
**Focus areas**
- Informative path planning  
- UAV–UGV collaborative mapping  
- Long-term localisation in visually aliased environments  
- Sensor fusion for resilient autonomy
